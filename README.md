When this project is done, it will be a small LMTP daemon that you can hook into any mailserver of yours.

Once that's running, you can forward it [digitec.ch](https://www.digitec.ch) collection notices which it will then convert into iOS Wallet passes which will be location aware and will automatically pop up as you get close to the store.

Right now, all this does is parsing the mails and creating the passes. LMTP support will come in a later instance

I'm not affiliated with Digitec. I'm just a good customer and I'm fed up with trying to dig their collection notices out of my mailbox. If they implement this on their own, that would be even better - then I can shut this down again.
